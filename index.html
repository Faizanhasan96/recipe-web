        <center>Life as a military spouse has taught me some important lessons.<br /> The most important? One must
            always be creative.<br />
    </p>

    <p>Whether it’s arranging a bedroom closet in Europe, or figuring out <br />the best way to ship my homemade pico de
        gallo to my husband in South Korea,<br /> I have learned how to get what I need (or want) when it’s not always
        available.
    </p>

    <p>The double-edged sword of life as a military spouse is that you can travel the world, <br />but you’re away from
        the comforts of home. We were living in Germany <br />when I fell in love with Bonefish Grill’s Bang Bang
        Shrimp®.
    </p>

    <p>I first tried it on a visit back to the States, but guess what Germany <br />doesn’t have? You guessed it!
        <p />

    <p>I craved that shrimp the most when I was pregnant with our twins,<br /> so I put on my culinary cape and set
        about creating my version of the dish

    <h2 id="What Is Bang Bang Shrimp">What Is Bang Bang Shrimp?</h2>
    <p>
        <b>The first star of this dish is the plump, crispy shrimp.</b> For these tacos, <br />I like to use extra-large
        shrimp, sometimes labeled as “26-30,” which refers <br />to the number of shrimp in a pound. To make this easy
        and time-friendly, I <br />buy them peeled and deveined with tails removed. Fiddling with shrimp <br />tails
        gets in the way when you’re trying to enjoy these tasty tacos.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>The other star of this recipe is the mildly spicy mayonnaise-based sauce</b><br />—the bang in the bang bang,
        I’d call it. The crispy shrimp is tossed in this<br /> creamy sauce just before serving. You can adjust the heat
        by reducing<br /> (or increasing!) the amount of sriracha in the mixture.
    </p>
    <h2 id="How to Get Extra-Crispy Shrimp">How to Get Extra-Crispy Shrimp</h2>
    <p>You can’t get around frying for the crispiest version of this shrimp.</p>
    <p><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Flour + Cornstarch:</b> Use a combination of flour and cornstarch for an
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crispy breading. It holds up under the sweet and spicy sauce.
    </p>
    <p><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dry then fry:</b>Use a thermometer to make sure that you’re
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frying at the right temperature. Maintaining that
        temperature<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throughout the cooking time is important, too. The shrimp is
        deep-<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fried at 350°F, so using a deep-fat frying thermometer to keep your
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oil right around that temperature is recommended.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep fry in batches:</b> Crowding the pan is a sure-fire way to drop your
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oil’s temperature (which results in a
        soggy, oily breading). Try to keep<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; batches on the smaller side to maintain the
        proper temperature. One<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; handful
        at a time (about 7 or 8 shrimp) is generally good.

    <h2 id="Make-Ahead Sauc">Make-Ahead Sauce</h2>
    <p>
        You can make the bang bang sauce a day or two in advance. <br> it covered in the refrigerator until ready to
        use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Allow the sauce to sit at room temperature while the shrimp is frying to<br> give it a chance to warm up. This
        way you’re not left with tepid shrimp<br> after tossing them in the cold-from-the-fridge sauce.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Serve Bang Bang Shrimp</h2>
    <p>
        I like to add shredded cabbage to my tacos to give a contrast of textures<br> and to temper the heat of the
        sauce a bit. The shrimp is served in<br> warmed flour tortillas; but, if you want to cut down on carbs, you
        can<br> serve them in lettuce leaves instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        I garnish my tacos with thinly sliced radishes and jalapeños, lime wedges,<br> chopped cilantro, and green
        onions. Letting my crew customize their<br> tacos is always a hit.
    </p>
    <h2 id="INGREDIENT"><ins>INGREDIENT:</ins></h2>
    <h2>For the bang bang sauce:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chili garlic sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce, optional </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><ins>For the shrimp:</ins></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds extra-large (26-30 count) shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>1 cup butter milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>6 cups vegetable oil for frying
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><ins>For serving:</ins></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 taco-sized flour tortillas, warmed (or Bibb lettuce leaves)</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded cabbage, about 3 cups</li>
        <li>Thinly sliced radishes </li>
        <li>Thinly sliced jalapeño peppers</li>
        <li>Sliced green onions</li>
        <li>Chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="METHOD"><ins>METHOD:</ins></h2>
    <h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Make the bang bang sauce:</h2>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a bowl, whisk the mayonnaise, chili garlic sauce, and<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sriracha together until blended. Store up to two days in the<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;refrigerator until ready to use.
    </p>
    <h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Marinate the shrimp:</h2>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a separate bowl, marinate the shrimp in the buttermilk for<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 minutes.
    </p>
    <h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare your breading station:</h2>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combine the flour, cornstarch, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set a cooling rack on top of a sheet pan on which to place the breaded
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shrimp prior to frying (this helps achieve a crispy coating on the
        shrimp).
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set up a draining station as well by lining another sheet pan<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with a thick layer of paper towels. (Or, if you have another <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cooling rack to set over the sheet pan, that’s even better!)
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the oven to 200°F.</p>

    <h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bread the shrimp:</h2>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the oil heats, drain the buttermilk and toss the shrimp, in
        batches, in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the flour mixture. Shake off any excess flour and arrange
        the shrimp on the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cooling rack to “dry out” while you’re heating your
        frying oil.
    </p>
    <h2>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heat the oil:</h2>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place a thermometer in a wide, deep pot, such as a
        Dutch<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oven, and add the oil. Heat over medium-high heat until
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the oil reaches 350°F. (This will take about 20 minutes.)
    </p>
    <h2>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fry the shrimp:</h2>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add a handful of the shrimp to the hot oil, and after a minute
        of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frying, use a slotted spoon to stir and
        separate the shrimp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they like to stick together. Fry for 4 to 4
        1/2 minutes,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or until the shrimp are golden
        brown.
    </p>
    <h2>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep the shrimp warm and continue<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frying:</h2>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the shrimp from the oil with a slotted spoon and place
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them on your draining rack/pan. Place the cooked
        shrimp<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the warm oven.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue frying the remaining shrimp in batches. Remember to
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the oil come back up to 350°F in between batches.
    </p>
    <h2>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sauce the shrimp:</h2>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once all of the shrimp has been fried, toss it all in 1 cup of
        the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sauce. Reserve the remaining sauce for drizzling on top of
        the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tacos.
    </p>
    <h2 id="Assemble the tacos">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assemble the tacos:</h2>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill the warmed tortillas with a handful of shredded
        cabbage,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then top the cabbage with the shrimp, then more sauce
        (if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desired). Garnish the tacos with sliced radishes, jalapeños,
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;green onions, and the chopped cilantro, then serve.
    </p>

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tacos are best enjoyed right away.
